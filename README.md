# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Predictions

We have used Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boost Algorithm to predict the Breast Cancer Diagnosed Patients. We have used jupyter ide to write the scipts in python, used hortonworks to create an instance, used Putty to SSH into that instance & executed the script on Spark 2.0 version. 

We founnd that Random Forest Performed better compared to other algorithms. The accuracy of RF algorithm is higher than the other two.
